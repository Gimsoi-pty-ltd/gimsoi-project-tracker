# Contributing Guidelines

These rules exist to keep delivery structured and predictable.

## Rules
- No direct pushes to `main`
- All work must be done on feature branches
- Pull Requests must reference a sprint and task
- CI checks must pass before merging

## Why This Matters
- Prevents breaking the system
- Keeps accountability clear
- Ensures work aligns with client value
