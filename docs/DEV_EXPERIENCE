Developer Experience & Data Safety Guide
Purpose

This document explains how developers should handle configuration, logging, and test data to keep the system secure and avoid accidental data leaks.

1. Configuration & Environment Variables

Secrets must never be hardcoded in source code.

All sensitive values must be read from environment variables.

Developers should use .env.example to know which variables are required.

Real secret values are stored only in GitHub Secrets or the deployment platform.

Example (Correct):

const apiKey = process.env.EXTERNAL_API_KEY;


Example (Not allowed):

const apiKey = "real-api-key";

2. Logging Rules (What NOT to Log)

Developers must never log:

Passwords or password hashes

API keys or tokens (JWTs, OAuth tokens)

Private keys or certificates

Environment variable values

Full request bodies that contain sensitive data

Personal user information (emails, phone numbers, addresses)

Allowed logs:

Error messages

Request IDs

High-level system events

3. Test Data Rules

Allowed test data:

Fake names and emails (e.g. user@test.local)

Mock IDs and placeholder tokens

Localhost URLs

Dummy values clearly marked as test data

Not allowed:

Real user or employee data

Production API keys

Copied production database records

Real credentials “just for testing”

4. Refactoring Configs to Environment Variables

Before (Not allowed):

const jwtSecret = "super-secret";


After (Correct):

const jwtSecret = process.env.JWT_SECRET;


Steps:

Remove hardcoded value

Use process.env

Add variable name to .env.example

Add real value via GitHub Secrets

Rotate the secret if it was exposed

5. CI & Guardrails

CI will fail if unsafe files are committed (e.g. .env, .key, .pem)

CI will block PRs if secrets are detected

Developers must remove and rotate exposed secrets immediately
