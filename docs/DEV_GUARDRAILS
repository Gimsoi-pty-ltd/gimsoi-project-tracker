 Allowed: .env.example (documentation only)

Purpose: Show developers which environment variables are required.

# Application
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000

# Database (fake values only)
DATABASE_URL=postgres://fake-user:fake-password@localhost:5432/db

# Auth (fake values only)
JWT_SECRET=fake-jwt-secret

# External services (fake values only)
EXTERNAL_API_KEY=fake-api-key


Rules:

.env.example is committed to git

Values must be fake placeholders

Used for onboarding and local setup

 Not Allowed: .env

.env contains real secrets

.env must never be committed

.env must always be ignored by git

2. Where Things Go (Simple Rules)
Goes in git:

Source code

.env.example

Config defaults (non-sensitive)

Documentation

Fake test data

Never goes in git:

Real API keys

Tokens or secrets

.env files

Certificates (.pem, .key, .p12)

Real user or business data

Cloud credentials

If it can grant access, it does not belong in git.

3. Pre-Merge Checklist (Required for All PRs)

Before approving or merging a pull request, confirm:

 No secrets committed to the repo

 No .env files added

 .env.example used for documentation only

 No real data in test fixtures

 Config values read from environment variables

 Logs do not expose sensitive information

If any item fails, the PR must not be merged.

4. Test Data Rules
Allowed test data:

Fake names and emails (e.g. test.user@example.local)

Dummy IDs and placeholder tokens

Mock data generated by tests

Clearly labelled sample data

Not allowed:

Real customer or employee data

Production database exports

Real API keys or tokens

Copied browser session tokens

Rule: If it looks real, it is unsafe.

5. Refactoring Configs to Environment Variables
Incorrect (Not allowed)
const apiKey = "real-api-key";

 Correct
const apiKey = process.env.EXTERNAL_API_KEY;


Steps when refactoring:

Remove hardcoded value

Replace with process.env.VARIABLE_NAME

Add variable name to .env.example

Store real value in secrets manager (not git)

Rotate secret if it was exposed

6. Logging Rules (What Never Gets Logged)

Do not log:

Passwords or hashes

Tokens (JWT, OAuth, Firebase)

API keys

Environment variable values

Full request bodies with sensitive data

Personal user information

Allowed logs:

Error messages

Request IDs

High-level status messages

Example:

 “Auth failed for userId=123”

 “Auth failed with token=eyJhbGciOi…”
